|Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.5
==========================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.5 on
October 2nd 2014. Downloads are available from our download site `here
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/2.2.5/>`_ and from
:ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories.

This release is the current stable release in the 2.2 series.

New Features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| has been rebased on |MySQL| 5.6.21.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 The fix for bug :bug:`1079700` introduced a problem for users with huge
 numbers of |InnoDB| tablespaces, and the workaround of raising the open files
 limits didn't work in all cases due to a limitation in the Linux kernel. A new
 :option:`innobackupex --close-files` option has been implemented to close the
 file handles once they are no longer accessed. **NOTE:** Using this option may
 result in a broken backup if DDL is performed on |InnoDB| tables during the
 backup procedure. Bug fixed :bug:`1222062`.

 Fix for bug :bug:`1206309` introduced a regression in |Percona XtraBackup|
 2.2.0 which caused |Percona XtraBackup| to fail to copy redo logs in random
 cases. Bug fixed :bug:`1365835`.

 :option:`innobackupex --galera-info` didn't copy the last binary log file when
 it was taking a backup from server where `backup locks
 <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html>`_
 are supported. Bug fixed :bug:`1368577`.

 |xtrabackup| binary would accept arguments that were not options, which could
 lead to unexpected results. Bug fixed :bug:`1367377`.

 If |innobackupex| is run against |MySQL| 5.1 with built-in InnoDB, it will now
 suggest using |Percona XtraBackup| 2.0 or upgrading to InnoDB plugin, rather
 than just failing with the generic ``unsupported server version`` message. Bug
 fixed :bug:`1335101`.

 Using the (deprecated) ``log`` parameter in mysqld section would cause backups
 to fail. Bug fixed :bug:`1347698`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now uses |MySQL| code to get the stack trace in case
 |Percona XtraBackup| crashes with a segmentation fault or an assertion
 failure. Bug fixed :bug:`766305`.

 Attempt to use any of the following options without the
 :option:`innobackupex --incremental` option now fails with an error message
 rather than creates a full backup: :option:`innobackupex --incremental-lsn`,
 :option:`innobackupex --incremental-basedir`,
 :option:`innobackupex --incremental-history-name`,
 :option:`innobackupex --incremental-history-uuid`. Bug fixed :bug:`1213778`.

Other bugs fixed: :bug:`1367613`, :bug:`1368574`, :bug:`1370462`,
:bug:`1371441`, :bug:`1373429`, :bug:`1373984`, and :bug:`1265070`.

All of Percona's software is open-source and free, all the details of the
release can be found in the `2.2.5 milestone
<https://launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+milestone/2.2.5>`_ at Launchpad.
