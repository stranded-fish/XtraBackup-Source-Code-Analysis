Bugs Fixed
----------

 Improved the detection when the log block that has the different number from
 what is expected, was caused by log block not being flushed to position
 xtrabackup is reading from or if it was caused by using incorrect last
 checkpoint LSN offset in our calculations. Bug fixed :bug:`1497912`.

 Fixed false positive error: ``The log was not applied to the intended LSN``
 which was happening even when the redo log was applied correctly. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1505017`.

 :file:`xtrabackup_logfile` was not compressed when :option:`--compress` option
 was used. Bug fixed :bug:`1242309`.

 |innobackupex| wrote error message to ``STDOUT`` instead of ``STDIN`` which
 broke xbstream and tar stream. Bug fixed :bug:`1503964`.

 Incremental backups did not work with |MariaDB| below 10.1.6. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1505865`.

Other bugs fixed: :bug:`1493015`.
