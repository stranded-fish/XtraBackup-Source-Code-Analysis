|Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.10
===========================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.10 on
March 31st 2015. Downloads are available from our download site `here
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/XtraBackup-2.2.10/>`_ and from
:ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories.

This release is the current stable release in the 2.2 series.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 Decrypting backup with the wrong key would make the backup unusable and
 unrecoverable. |innobackupex| doesn't automatically delete the :file:`*.qp`
 and :file:`.xbcrypt` files anymore, after :option:`innobackupex --decrypt`
 and :option:`innobackupex --decompress` are used. Bug fixed :bug:`1413044`.

 `XtraDB Changed Page Tracking
 <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/changed_page_tracking.html>`_
 wasn't working with |innobackupex|. Bug fixed :bug:`1436793`.

 Fixed |Percona XtraBackup| assertion caused by dirty pages remaining in the
 buffer pool after the log was fully applied. Bug fixed :bug:`1368846`.

 Backup will not be prepared and |innobackupex| will stop with an error if the
 transaction log file is corrupted and it wasn't applied to the intended LSN.
 Previously this was showing only as a warning. Bug fixed :bug:`1414221`.

 New status ``log-applied`` is introduced for backup prepared with
 :option:`innobackupex --redo-only` to avoid making the backup unusable by
 preparing full or incremental backup without :option:`--redo-only` and then
 applying next incremental on top of it. Incremental backup now can be applied
 only to backup in ``log-applied`` state, but not to ``full-prepared`` as it
 was earlier. Bug fixed :bug:`1436790`.
