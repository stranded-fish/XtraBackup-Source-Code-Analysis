==========================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.4 on
September 12th 2014. Downloads are available from our download site `here
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/2.2.4/>`_ and from
:ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories.

This release is the current stable release in the 2.2 series.

New Features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| has implemented support for Galera GTID autorecovery.
 |Percona XtraBackup| retrieves the GTID information, after backing up a server
 with `backup locks
 <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html>`_
 support, from the |InnoDB| trx header on recovery and creates the
 :file:`xtrabackup_galera_info` during that stage.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 |Percona XtraBackup| is now built with system ``zlib`` library instead of the
 older bundled one. Bug fixed :bug:`1108016`.

 ``apt-get source`` was downloading older version of |Percona XtraBackup|. Bug
 fixed :bug:`1363259`.

 |innobackupex| would ignore the :option:`innobackupex --databases` without
 :option:`innobackupex --stream` option and back up all the databases. Bug
 fixed :bug:`569387`.

 ``rsync`` package wasn't a dependency although it is required for the
 :option:`innobackupex --rsync` option. Bug fixed :bug:`1259436`.

 :option:`innobackupex --galera-info` was checking only for non-capitalized
 ``wsrep_*`` status variables which was incompatible with *MariaDB Galera
 Cluster* 10.0. Bug fixed :bug:`1306875`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now supports *MariaDB* GTID. Bugs fixed :bug:`1329539`
 and :bug:`1326967` (*Nirbhay Choubey*).
