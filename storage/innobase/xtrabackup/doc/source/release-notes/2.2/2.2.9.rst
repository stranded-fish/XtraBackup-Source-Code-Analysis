Bugs Fixed
----------

 |Percona XtraBackup| was vulnerable to MITM attack which could allow
 exfiltration of MySQL configuration information via
 :option:`innobackupex --version-check` option. This vulnerability was logged
 as `CVE 2015-1027
 <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-1027>`_. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1408375`.

 :file:`xtrabackup_galera_info` isn't overwritten during the Galera
 auto-recovery. Bug fixed :bug:`1418584`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| man pages are now included with binary packages. Bug
 fixed :bug:`1156209`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now sets the maximum supported session value for
 :option:`lock_wait_timeout` to prevent unnecessary timeouts when the global
 value is changed from the default. Bug fixed :bug:`1410339`.

 New option :option:`innobackupex --backup-locks`, enabled by default, has been
 implemented to control if `backup locks
 <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html>`_
 will be used even if they are supported by the server. To disable backup locks
 |innobackupex| should be run with :option:`innobackupex --no-backup-locks`
 option. Bug fixed :bug:`1418820`.
