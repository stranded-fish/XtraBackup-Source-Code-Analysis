New Features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| has been rebased on |MySQL| 5.6.24.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 Version check would crash |innobackupex| and abort the backup on *CentOS* 5.
 Bug fixed :bug:`1255451`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| could crash when preparing the backup taken on
 |MySQL|/|Percona Server| 5.5 if there were open temporary tables during the
 backup. Bug fixed :bug:`1399471` (*Fungo Wang*).

 |Percona XtraBackup| would fail to prepare the backup if the
 :file:`xtrabackup_logfile` was lager than 512GB. Bug fixed :bug:`1425269`.

 Fix for bug :bug:`1403237` was incomplete, due to setting wrong offset, last
 copied batch of log records was copied from wrong location. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1448447`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now executes an extra ``FLUSH TABLES`` before executing
 ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to potentially lower the impact from ``FLUSH
 TABLES WITH READ LOCK``. Bug fixed :bug:`1277403`.

 Regression introduced by fixing :bug:`1436793` in |Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.10
 caused an error when taking an incremental backup from *MariaDB* 10. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1444541`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now prints and stores the file based binlog coordinates
 in :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_info` even though GTID is enabled. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1449834`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| doesn't print warnings anymore during the prepare phase
 about missing tables when a filtering option (:option:`--databases`,
 :option:`--tables`, etc.) is provided. Bug fixed :bug:`1454815` (*Davi
 Arnaut*).

Other bugs fixed: :bug:`1415191`.
