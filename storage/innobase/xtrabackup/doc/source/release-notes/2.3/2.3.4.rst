============================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.3.4 on March
17th 2016. Downloads are available from our `download site
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/Percona-XtraBackup-2.3.4/>`_ and

This release is the current GA (Generally Available) stable release in the 2.3
series.

Bugs fixed
----------

 |Percona XtraBackup| didn't respect variables stored in :file:`backup-my.cnf`
 unless it was specified. One needed to specify
 ``--defaults-file=backup-my.cnf`` for options to be respected. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1527081`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| didn't abort the backup if :option:`innobackupex --rsync`
 completed with error. Bug fixed :bug:`1537256`.

 When backup was taken on *MariaDB* 10 with GTID enabled, |Percona XtraBackup|
 didn't store ``gtid_slave_pos`` in :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` but logged it
 only to ``STDERR``. Bug fixed :bug:`1404484`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| was silently skipping extra arguments. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1533542` (*Fungo Wang*).

 |Percona XtraBackup| refuses client connecting to server if it uses old
 (pre-4.1.1) protocol. To disable this check in order to allow backing up
 servers with legacy passwords still set, new
 :option:`xtrabackup --skip-secure-auth` option has been implemented. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1508450`.
