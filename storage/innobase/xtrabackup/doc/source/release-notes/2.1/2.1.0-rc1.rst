|Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.0-rc1
=======================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.0-rc1 on May 7th 2013. Downloads are available from our download site `here <http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/2.1.0-rc1/>`_. For this *RC* release, we will not be making APT and YUM repositories available, just base deb and RPM packages.

This is an *Release Candidate* quality release and is not intended for production. If you want a high quality, Generally Available release, the current Stable version should be used (currently 2.0.7 in the 2.0 series at the time of writing).

New features
------------

 This version of |Percona XtraBackup| has implemented full support for new |MySQL| 5.6 features (``GTID``, remote/transportable tablespaces, separate undo tablespace, 5.6-style buffer pool dump files).

 |Percona XtraBackup| has implemented support for the `InnoDB Buffer Pool Preloading <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-performance.html#innodb-preload-buffer-pool>`_ introduced in |MySQL| 5.6. Starting with |MySQL| 5.6 buffer pool dumps can be produced and loaded for faster server warmup after the start. This feature is similar to the `Dump/Restore of the Buffer Pool <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/management/innodb_lru_dump_restore.html>`_ in |Percona Server|. |MySQL| 5.6 buffer pool dump is copied into backup directory during the backup stage. During the copy back stage (restore) it is copied back to data directory. After the backup is restored buffer pool dump can be loaded by the server either automatically on startup or on demand.

 Time interval between checks done by log copying thread is now configurable by :option:`innobackupex --log-copy-interval`. Making the interval configurable allows to reduce the time between checks which can prevent |Percona XtraBackup| failures that are caused by the log records in the transactional log being overwritten before they are copied by the log copying thread.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now stores the ``GTID`` value in the :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_info` when doing the backup of |MySQL| and |Percona Server| 5.6 with the ``GTID`` mode enabled. Example of how this information can be used to create/restore a slave can be found in `this blogpost <http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/02/08/how-to-createrestore-a-slave-using-gtid-replication-in-mysql-5-6/>`_.

 |Percona XtraBackup| option :option:`xtrabackup --export` now supports transportable tablespaces introduced in |MySQL| 5.6. This option can be used to produce 5.6-style metadata files, that can be imported by ``ALTER TABLE IMPORT TABLESPACE`` on |MySQL| and |Percona Server| 5.6 as described in :ref:`export_import_tables` guide.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 |Percona XtraBackup| would crash when preparing the 5.6 backup with partitioned tables. Bug fixed :bug:`1169169`.

 Tables that were dropped between taking a full backup and an incremental one were present in the full backup directory, and were not removed when incremental backups has been merged. Fixed by removing files corresponding to tables that are missing in the incremental backup directory. Bug fixed :bug:`856400`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| would leave stale ``xtrabackup_tmp*`` files in the :term:`datadir` after applying incremental backups. Bug fixed :bug:`1079135`.

 If there are thousands of tables and slow IO then |Percona XtraBackup| can spend a lot of time opening all the tablespaces. Optimization has been implemented and |Percona XtraBackup| now avoids loading non-relevant tablespaces when partial backup is being taken which speeds up the backup process. Bug fixed :bug:`1130145`.

 Due to different implementation in |MySQL| 5.6 error messages were not printed to ``stderr`` directly. Because of that all InnoDB error or diagnostic messages are never printed by xtrabackup_56. Bug fixed :bug:`1169971`

 |innobackupex| would still run with ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` even if |xtrabackup| would fail when copying logs. Fixed by terminating |xtrabackup| process immediately on log copying failure. Bug fixed :bug:`1170806`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| would leave ``xbtemp`` temp files behind due to a typo. Bug fixed :bug:`1172016`.

 |innobackupex| wasn't handling the :option:`innodb_data_file_path` option which could cause backup to fail. Bug fixed :bug:`1169726`.

 For the *Debian* and the *Linux* binaries, the :option:`--version` message which should include the revision was showing "undefined". Bug fixed :bug:`1171721`.

Other bugs fixed: bug fixed :bug:`1088307`, bug fixed :bug:`1088309`, bug fixed :bug:`1170340`.
