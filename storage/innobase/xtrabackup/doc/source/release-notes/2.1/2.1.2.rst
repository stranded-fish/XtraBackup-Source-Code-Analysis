Bugs Fixed
----------

 Using Perl's ``DBD::MySQL`` package for server communication instead of spawning the mysql command line client introduced a regression which caused :option:`innobackupex --galera-info` to fail. Bug fixed :bug:`1180672`.

 The format of :file:`xtrabackup_galera_info` was missing the ':' separator between the values of :option:`wsrep_local_state_uuid` and :option:`wsrep_last_committed`. Bug fixed :bug:`1181222`.

 |innobackupex| automatic version detection did not work correctly for latest |Percona Server| and |MySQL| 5.1 releases which could cause innobackupex to fail. Bugs fixed :bug:`1181092`, :bug:`1181099` and :bug:`1180905`.

 When backing up a server that is not a replication slave with the :option:`innobackupex --slave-info` option, |innobackupex| failed with a fatal error. Replaced the fatal error with a diagnostic message about :option:`innobackupex --slave-info` being ignored in such a case. Bug fixed :bug:`1180662`.

 Low values for ``wait_timeout`` on the server could cause server to close the connection while backup is being taken. Fixed by setting the bigger value for ``wait_timeout`` option on the server to prevent server from closing connections if the global ``wait_timeout`` value is set too low. Bug fixed :bug:`1180922`.

Other bug fixes: bug fixed :bug:`1177182`.
