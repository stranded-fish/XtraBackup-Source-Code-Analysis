 |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.4 
============================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.4 on August 8th 2013. Downloads are available from our download site `here <http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/XtraBackup-2.1.4/>`_ and :doc:`Percona Software Repositories </installation>`.

New Features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| has introduced :ref:`additional options <improved_ftwrl>` to handle the locking during the ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``. These options can be used to minimize the amount of the time when |MySQL| operates in the read-only mode.

 |Percona XtraBackup| has now been rebased on |MySQL| versions 5.1.70, 5.5.30, 5.6.11 and |Percona Server| versions 5.1.70-rel14.8 and 5.5.31-rel30.3 server versions.

 In order to speed up the backup process, slave thread is not stopped during copying non-InnoDB data when :option:`innobackupex --no-lock` option is used as using this option requires absence of ``DDL`` or ``DML`` to non-transaction tables during backup.

 Source tarball (and Debian source) now include all |MySQL| source trees required for the build. This means internet connection during package build isn't required anymore.

 Two new options options, :option:`innobackupex --decrypt` and :option:`innobackupex --decompress`, have been implemented to make :ref:`decryption <encrypted_backups_ibk>` and :ref:`decompression <recipes_ibkx_compressed>` process more user friendly.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 There were no 2.1.x release packages available for *Ubuntu Raring*. Bug fixed :bug:`1199257`.

 During the backup process loading tablespaces was started before the log copying, this could lead to a race between the datafiles state in the resulting backup and xtrabackup_logfile. Tablespace created at a sensitive time would be missing in both the backup itself and as the corresponding log record in :file:`xtrabackup_logfile`, so it would not be created on :option:`innobackupex --apply-log` either. Bug fixed :bug:`1177206`.

 Fixed the ``libssl.so.6`` dependency issues in binary tarballs releases. Bug fixed :bug:`1172916`.

 |innobackupex| did not encrypt non-InnoDB files when doing local (i.e. non-streaming) backups. Bug fixed :bug:`1160778`.

 Difference in behavior between |InnoDB| 5.5 and 5.6 codebases in cases when a newly created tablespace has uninitialized first page at the time when |Percona XtraBackup| opens it while creating a list of tablespaces to backup would cause assertion error. Bug fixed :bug:`1187071`. 

 **xbcrypt** could sometimes fail when reading encrypted stream from a pipe or network. Bug fixed :bug:`1190610`.

 |innobackupex| could not prepare the backup if there was no :file:`xtrabackup_binary` file in the backup directory and the xtrabackup binary was not specified explicitly with :option:`innobackupex --ibbackup` option. Bug fixed :bug:`1199190`.

 Debug builds would fail due to compiler errors on *Ubuntu* Quantal/Raring builds. Fixed compiler warnings by backporting the corresponding changes from upstream. Bug fixed :bug:`1192454`.

 |innobackupex| would terminate with an error if :option:`innobackupex --safe-slave-backup` option was used for backing up the master server. Bug fixed :bug:`1190716`.

 Under some circumstances |Percona XtraBackup| could fail on a backup prepare with ``innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT`` when ``XFS`` filesystem was being used. Bug fixed :bug:`1190779`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| didn't recognize checkpoint ``#0`` as a valid checkpoint on :option:`xtrabackup --prepare` which would cause an error. Bug fixed :bug:`1196475`.
 
 |Percona XtraBackup| didn't recognize the ``O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC`` value for :option:`innodb_flush_method` which was introduced in |MySQL| 5.6.7. Fixed by adding the value to the list of supported values for :option:`innodb_flush_method` in ``xtrabackup_56``. Bug fixed :bug:`1206363`. 

 |innobackupex| would terminate if :option:`innobackupex --galera-info` option was specified when backing up non-galera server. Bug fixed :bug:`1192347`.

Known Issues
------------

 Backups of |MySQL| / |Percona Server| 5.6 versions prior to 5.6.11 cannot be prepared with |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.4. Until the upstream bug :mysqlbug:`69780` is fixed and merged into |Percona XtraBackup|, |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.3 should be used to prepare and restore such backups. This issue is reported as bug :bug:`1203669`.
