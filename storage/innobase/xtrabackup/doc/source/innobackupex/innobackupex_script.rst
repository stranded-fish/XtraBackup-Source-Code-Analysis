=========================
 The innobackupex Script
=========================

The |innobackupex| tool is a *Perl* script that acts as a wrapper for the :doc:`xtrabackup <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` *C* program. It is a patched version of the ``innobackup`` *Perl* script that *Oracle* distributes with the *InnoDB Hot Backup* tool. It enables more functionality by integrating |xtrabackup| and other functions such as file copying and streaming, and adds some convenience. It lets you perform point-in-time backups of |InnoDB| / |XtraDB| tables together with the schema definitions, |MyISAM| tables, and other portions of the server.

This manual section explains how to use |innobackupex| in detail.
