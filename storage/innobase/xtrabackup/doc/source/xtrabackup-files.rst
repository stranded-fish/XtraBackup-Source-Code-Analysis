Index of files created by Percona XtraBackup
============================================

* Information related to the backup and the server

    * :file:`backup-my.cnf`
       This file contains information to start the mini instance of InnoDB
       during the :option:`xtrabackup --prepare`. This is **NOT** a backup of
       original :file:`my.cnf`. The InnoDB configuration is read from the file
       :file:`backup-my.cnf` created by |innobackupex| when the backup was
       made. :option:`xtrabackup --prepare` uses InnoDB configuration from
       ``backup-my.cnf`` by default, or from
       :option:`xtrabackup --defaults-file`, if specified. InnoDB
       configuration in this context means server variables that affect data
       format, i.e. ``innodb_page_size`` option,
       ``innodb_log_block_size``, etc. Location-related variables, like
       ``innodb_log_group_home_dir`` or ``innodb_data_file_path``
       are always ignored by :option:`xtrabackup --prepare`, so preparing
       a backup always works with data files from the backup directory, rather
       than any external ones.

    * :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints`
       The type of the backup (e.g. full or incremental), its state (e.g.
       prepared) and the |LSN| range contained in it. This information is used
       for incremental backups.
       Example of the :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints` after taking a full
       backup:

       .. code-block:: text

         backup_type = full-backuped
         from_lsn = 0
         to_lsn = 15188961605
         last_lsn = 15188961605

       Example of the :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints` after taking an incremental
       backup:

       .. code-block:: text

         backup_type = incremental
         from_lsn = 15188961605
         to_lsn = 15189350111
         last_lsn = 15189350111

    * :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_info`
       The binary log file used by the server and its position at the moment of
       the backup. Result of the :command:`SHOW MASTER STATUS`.

    * :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_pos_innodb`
       The binary log file and its current position for |InnoDB| or |XtraDB|
       tables.

    * :file:`xtrabackup_binary`
       The |xtrabackup| binary used in the process.

    * :file:`xtrabackup_logfile`
       Contains data needed for running the: :option:`xtrabackup --prepare`.
       The bigger this file is the :option:`xtrabackup --prepare` process
       will take longer to finish.

    * :file:`<table_name>.delta.meta`
       This file is going to be created when performing the incremental backup.
       It contains the per-table delta metadata: page size, size of compressed
       page (if the value is 0 it means the tablespace isn't compressed) and
       space id. Example of this file could looks like this:

       .. code-block:: text

        page_size = 16384
        zip_size = 0
        space_id = 0

    * :file:`<table_name>.ibd.pmap`
       This file contains ranges of skipped secondary index pages. These files
       are created only when doing the compact backup. The file format is a
       series of 2-value tuples, with each value being a 4-byte page offset
       corresponding to the first and the last endpoints of skipped ranges,
       respectively.

* Information related to the replication environment (if using the
  :option:`xtrabackup --slave-info` option):

    * :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info`
       The ``CHANGE MASTER`` statement needed for setting up a slave.

* Information related to the *Galera* and *Percona XtraDB Cluster* (if using
  the :option:`xtrabackup --galera-info` option):

    * :file:`xtrabackup_galera_info`
       Contains the values of ``wsrep_local_state_uuid`` and
       ``wsrep_last_committed`` status variables
